# My Work Experience

<div class="work-callout">
For my next role I am looking to contribute to something very interesting and helpful, where I can explore, research and create new technology (that's why I love startups), especially if it is using Flutter, as it is my favorite technology!<br>
Communities are something important to me, so I would really like to work in a place where they drive/support them (or their events). <br>
If you think we could be a good fit, don't hesitate to reach out to me on<b> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sofitoro/" t arget="_blank">LinkedIn</a></b> <img width="24" src="../images/blue-junimo.png"/>

      <h3>Flutter Developer Intern | Bamboo Tec</h3>
      During my time in this startup, I mainly worked on a package that connects the mobile app to electric vehicle lithium batteries in order to monitor them, so that users know the status of their vehicle and receive alerts about problems with their battery. My main achievements were:
      <ul>
          <li><b>Created a Flutter plugin</b> to manage the <b>connection to lithium batteries</b> through Bluetooth (with BLE protocol), written entirely in Dart, leading to a <b>50% reduction in development time</b> by eliminating the need to create two separate native implementations in Swift and Kotlin.</li>
          <li><b>Identified local storage pain points</b> that generated uncontrolled growth in the size of the application and effectively managed these points by limiting data-writing to storage to specific times, therefore <b>reducing the size of the application from over 5GB to 123MB.</b></li>
          <li><b>Optimized</b> the data model used in <b>Firebase Firestore</b> by denormalizing, adding replication and using indexes for efficient queries, resulting in a <b>substantial reduction in the costs</b> involved in this service.</li>
          <li><b>Implemented a Continuous Delivery</b> workflow with <b>GitHub Actions</b> for the creation of the <b>APK.</b></li>
          <li>Provided <b>mentoring and guide to new interns</b> who joined the team.</li>

      <h3>Flutter Developer | Jalasoft (Contractor)</h3>
      I could say that this was my first approach to startups. As winner of the Climate Action Hackathon, my team and I received a contract to develop our product Mikhuy, a mobile application (made in <b>Flutter</b>!) to purchase instant consumer products at a lower price.
      <br>Here I was in charge from <b>defining requirements for an MVP</b> to the implementation of several of them, prioritizing the needs of our users. In addition, I <b>communicated with potential investors</b>, learned how to negotiate, and found improvements for our development process. Some interesting features that I implemented are:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Cloud Tasks from Google Cloud Platform</b> to schedule expiration of reservations, <b>connected to Cloud Functions from Firebase</b> to automatically cancel reservations upon expiration and update product stock.</li>
        <li>Map manipulation through <b>Google Maps API</b> to interactively display partner supermarkets (zoom in, automatic focus, filtering through open and close time).</li>
      </ul>
